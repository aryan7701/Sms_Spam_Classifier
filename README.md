# SMS Spam Detection
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to detect spam messages in SMS text data. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a supervised learning algorithm to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham).
### DATASET
The dataset used for this project is the "SMS Spam Collection" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains a collection of 5,574 SMS messages, labeled as spam or ham. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.


The dataset file (spam.csv) contains two columns:

  1) label: Indicates whether the message is spam (1) or ham (0).
  2) text: The actual text content of the SMS message.
